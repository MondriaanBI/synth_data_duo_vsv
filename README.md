# Synthesize DUO VSV data  
- Use the Jypyter Notebook synth_ceda.ipynb to create synthetic data based on the Voortijdig schoolverlaters (**VSV**) data that Dienst Uitvoering Onderwijs (**DUO**) provides to educational institutions. 
- Old synthetic data is stored in the folder data/raw for testing purposes. Replace these files with your own DUO VSV files and change the relative paths to your files in the Jupyter Notebook accordingly
- New synthetic data will be created and stored in the folder data/output
